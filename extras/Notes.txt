  It's not that hard.

  As usually there is idle cycle "(for i = 0, N)()" to keep line
  state long enough.

  That <N> value is amount of 16-clocks ticks (or 8-clocks ticks for
  double speed mode).

  That <N> value is stored in 14 bits, so max(N) = 4095.
  So maximum delay is 4096 * 16-clock ticks. 65536 ticks.
  For 16 MHz it is near 4 ms. (4096 us to be precise.)

  So lowest baud rate is near 250 bps (1000 / 4). Highest baud rate
  is 1 Mbps (or 100 KB / s). Will transfer megabyte in ten seconds.
  Not enough for porn but not bad actually.

  WTF is "double speed"?!

  How fuck we can send at double speed at 115200?

  It's bit 1 at byte 192. Internally it divides idle loop delay by two.
  So twofold value of loop counter is needed for same delay.
  More speed tuning precision possible.

  Also looks like "idle loop" is not really idle.

  In normal mode it runs in 16 ticks. And takes 16 measurements. Middle
  3 of them are used to determine bit value.

  In double speed mode it runs in 8 ticks. And takes 8 measurements.
  Same middle 3 are used for sampling.

  So no much difference. Double mode doubles theoretical max speed,
  and halves minimum possible speed. Less time granularity, so
  theoretically better for matching announced speed. Theoretically
  worse sampling quality, so more reading errors possible.

  No much difference. I'll stick to "normal" mode for now.
